    <header>
        <p>The header uses the <strong>fixed</strong> position property, which means it is positioned relative to the viewport. The <strong>top</strong> property is set to 0, so the header is placed at the very top of the page. The <strong>width</strong> is set to 90%, making it span most of the viewport's width, and the <strong>margin</strong> of 25px creates space around the header, ensuring it doesn't touch the edges.</p>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <p>The navigation bar also uses the <strong>fixed</strong> position property, meaning it stays in place even when the page is scrolled. The <strong>top</strong> property is set to 170px, positioning it below the header, and the <strong>left</strong> property is set to 35px, moving it slightly to the right. This ensures the navigation bar is easily accessible and visually distinct from the header.</p>
    </nav>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="articles">
            <article>
                <p>This article is part of a flex container with a <strong>flex-direction</strong> of column, meaning the articles are stacked vertically. The <strong>flex</strong> property is set to 1, allowing the article to grow and fill the available space within the container. The <strong>margin</strong> is set to 0, ensuring no extra space is added around the article.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>This article follows the same positioning rules as the previous one, being part of the same flex container. The <strong>flex</strong> property allows it to adjust its size based on the available space, ensuring a consistent layout.</p>
            </article>
        </div>
        <aside>
            <p>The aside element is positioned next to the articles within the flex container. Its <strong>width</strong> is set to 50%, making it take up half of the available space, and its <strong>height</strong> is set to 420px, matching the height of the articles. This ensures a balanced and visually appealing layout.</p>
        </aside>
    </div>
    <footer>
        <p>The footer uses the <strong>fixed</strong> position property, meaning it stays at the bottom of the viewport regardless of scrolling. The <strong>bottom</strong> property is set to 0, placing it at the very bottom of the page. The <strong>width</strong> is set to 100%, making it span the entire width of the viewport, ensuring it is always visible and accessible.</p>
    </footer>
